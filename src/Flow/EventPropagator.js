      // use this node to control the speed of even propagation through the nodes
      // write onChange event handler for each node that will detect any change that happens, example move, edge change, node change, 
      // have source node inforamtion and current node information
      // any change happens, will update the current node's data
      // 1. find how to update visual stayle of current node - not important
      // 2. find how to add a focus ring that cross from left to right?
      // start with a vertical line
      // no that does not look like emitter. light flow or a fluid flow effect that gets triggered from the node and the edge as well.
      // mimic how the animate on edge happen, try the same on edge and the node as well.

      // A node receives event from its input node
      // A node can modify the event object
      // A node passes the event to all its output nodes
